ZOHMG DONE QUICK
----------------
Screw all those dependencies and details, huh?

Just run

    sudo python install.py

Afterwards it should be possible to run

   zohmg

and get the usage printed. (The application is installed.)



DEPENDENCIES
------------
zohmg depends on several pieces of software:

- Apache Hadoop (0.19.1)

    MapReduce framework implemented in Java.

    Additionally Hadoop source has to be patched with the patches
    HADOOP-1722 and HADOOP-5450.

    For more information see http://hadoop.org/.


- Apache HBase (0.19.1)

    BigTable inspired database implemented in Java.

    Usually runs best if this is the same version as Hadoop.

    For more information see http://hbase.org/.


- Apache Thrift

    Framework for scalable cross-language service development.

    zohmg is tested to work with svn revision [TODO: add revision here.] of
    Thrift.

    For more information see http://incubator.thrift.org/thrift/.


- Dumbo (0.21.x)

    Python module which wraps around Hadoop Streaming and makes it possible
    to write MapReduce programs in Python.

    For more information see http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo.


- Python Paste

    Tools for using a Web Server Gateway Interface stack.

    There is a debian package called python-paste.

    For more information see http://pythonpaste.org/.


- Python Setup Tools

    Framework for building, installing, upgrading and uninstalling Python
    packages.

    There is a Debian package called python-setuptools.

    For more information see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools.


- Python simplejson

    Simple, fast, extensible JSON encoder/decoder for Python.

    There is a Debian package called python-simplejson.

    For more information see http://undefined.org/python/#simplejson.

- PyYAML

    YAML parser and emitter for Python.

    There is a Debian package called python-yaml.

    For more information see http://pyyaml.org/.



INSTALLING ZOHMG
----------------
Make sure you have the dependencies installed correctly on your system.

Asserting that all the dependencies are ok run

    sudo python install.py

The above command creates a python egg out of zohmg and puts it in
system-wide site-packages directory.

Additionally it creates directories /usr/local/share/zohmg and
/usr/local/lib/zohmg, where documentation and library files are put
respectively.

It is now possible to run the command zohmg on the system.
