The darling package contains an OutputReader and an IdentifierResolver used by
zohmg's python code to interpret JSON output and write to an TableOutputFormat.

Also, there is quite a bit else in there, like a Java mapper-wrapper and stuff.
Later, I might want to move this into another package or something.

build requirements:
hadoop-dev-core.jar
hadoop-dev-streaming.jar
hbase-dev.jar
commons-logging.jar

also, patch hadoop with 1722 and 5450.
