The darling package contains an OutputReader and an IdentifierResolver used by zohmg's python code
to interpret JSON output and write to an TableOutputFormat.

Also, there is quite a bit else in there, like a Java mapper-wrapper and stuff.
Later, I might want to move this into another package or something.

build requirements:
hadoop-dev-core.jar
hadoop-dev-streaming.jar
hbase-dev.jar
commons-logging.jar

Use a version >= 0.19.1 of hadoop & hbase and Success is Certain (tm).
