DEPENDENCIES
------------

Zohmg depends on a number of software packages and Python modules.

The installation procedure described in INSTALL will take care of
these dependencies for you, except for patched versions of 
Hadoop and HBase. Please see install_hadoop_hbase.sh in the scripts
directory for an automated installation of those.


The following software is required:
 - Apache Hadoop 0.19.x with patches HADOOP-1722 and HADOOP-5450.
 - Apache HBase 0.19.x
 - Dumbo 0.21.x
