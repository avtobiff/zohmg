DEPENDENCIES
------------

Zohmg depends on a number of software packages and Python modules.

The installation procedure described in INSTALL will take care of
these dependencies for you, except for patched versions of 
Hadoop and HBase. Please see scripts/install_hadoop_hbase.sh 
for an assisted installation of Hadoop and HBase.


The following software is required:
 - Apache Hadoop 0.20 with patches HADOOP-1722 and HADOOP-5450.
 - Apache HBase 0.20
 - Dumbo >=0.21.17

These python modules come bundled:
 - PyYAML
 - Python Paste
 - Python simplejson
