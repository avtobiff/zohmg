DEPENDENCIES
------------
The following software and versions are required:
- Apache Hadoop, svn branch-0.19.
- Apache HBase, same version as Hadoop.
- Apache Thrift, 20080420
- Dumbo, git clone suffices.
- Python Setup Tools



INSTALLING
----------
Download the distribution tar archive

    wget someurl/zohmg-alpha-*.tar.gz

Extract the contents

    tar zxvf zohmg-alpha-*.tar.gz

Install zohmg

    cd zohmg-alpha-*
    python install.py



RUNNING
-------
During installation the zohmg script is installed system-wide. This is the
interface to zohmg. Try it out by running

    zohmg


Creating a project
------------------
By running

    zohmg create project-name

a project named "project-name" is created. A project directory is created
from the project skeleton. The contents:

- config/, project environment and dataset configuration.
- lib/, user eggs or jars to be used by the import step (mappers).
- mappers/, user defined map part of the mapreduce import procedure.
- transformers/, user defined transformations of the data to extract.
- README, mentions where to find additional documentation.


Configuring a project
---------------------
When the project is created the files environment.py and dataset.yaml in
the config directory will need to be configured.

In config/environment.py define the path to the hadoop directory and the
path to the three required jars (hadoop-*-dev-core.jar,
hadoop-*-dev-streaming.jar and hbase-*-dev.jar).

In config/dataset.yaml define your data set. This means setting up what
dimensions and what projections of these dimensions will be used in by the
project. The dimensions and projections defines how data can be imported
later, it also hints what queries can be made to extract data.

During import the mapper will output measurements based on the input data
into these defined dimensions.

Below two dimensions, three projections and one unit is defined in a
dataset yaml file.

    dataset: weblogs

    dimensions:
     - user
     - status

    projections:
     - user
     - status
     - user-status

    units:
     - pageviews


When the configuration is done run

    zohmg setup

to execute the changes and create the needed infrastructure (HBase tables).


Importing data
--------------
After the project is created and setup correctly it is time to import some
data. This is done in two steps: Write a mapper and then running that
mapper. The mapper maps each line of the log file to a measurement along
the dimension axes.

Firstly, writing the mapper. (Assuming Apache common log format, see
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/logs.html for more information.)

In the arguments to map there are key and value. The argument key is the
row number in the file being processed, the value argument is the actual
line data from the file.

The access time, user (HTTP auth) and the status for each request are
requested and passed along to the data store.

    def map(key,value):
        # parse log string, extract year, month and day
        import re
        mo = re.search(r"\[(\d{2})/(\w{3})/(\d{4})",value) # [20/Apr/2009
        year  = mo.group(3)
        month = mo.group(2)
        day   = mo.group(1)

        time  = year + month + day
        dimensions = {'user'   : value.split(" ")[2],
                      'status' : value.split(" ")[8]
                     }
        values = {'pageviews' : 1}

        yield time,dimensions,values


The map function is really a generator; it can yield zero or more times for
every line of the log file.

The output of the mapper goes into a reducir that, for each
dimension-tuple, sums the values of each unit and passes them along to the
actual underlying data stare.

Secondly, run the mapper

    zohmg import mappers/mapper.py input

where mappers/mapper.py is defined above and input is a path to a file on
HDFS on the Hadoop cluster.

When the above is done data has been processed and stored.


Serving the data
----------------
Data is served out of HBase. The data server uses the Thrift interface to
HBase so make sure it is on (i.e. run hbase thrift start).

Start the data server with

    zohmg serve

Visiting the url for extracting data and supplying query string with what
data to retrieve:

    http://127.0.0.1:8086/?t0=20090420&t1=20090423&unit=pageviews&d0=user&d0v=goldman,kropotkin

The result returned is a JSON feed of the data with the pageviews done by
users goldman and kropotkin.
