ZOHMG QUICK START
-----------------

First a few dependencies need to be fulfilled:

- Apache Hadoop 0.19.1 with patches HADOOP-1722 and HADOOP-5450.
- Apache HBase 0.19.1
- Dumbo, git clone suffices.
- Python Paste
- Python Setup Tools
- Python simplejson
- PyYAML

Now download and install:

    wget someurl/zohmg-alpha-*.tar.gz
    tar zxvf zohmg-alpha-*.tar.gz
    cd zohmg-alpa-*
    sudo python install.py

The zohmg application is now installed system-wide.

Creating a project and using it:

    zohmg create project-name

Change to the newly created zohmg project directory and edit the
configuration files. (See examples for inspiration.)

    cd project-name
    vim config/environment.py
    vim config/dataset.yaml

Commit the configuration to the project (this creates HBase tables).

    zohmg setup

Next step is to write a mapper and put it in the mappers directory. When
this step is fulfilled import data from HDFS with the mapper by invoking

    zohmg import mappers/mapper.py hdfs/input/path

Serving already imported data with zohmg by invoking

    zohmg serve

Visit the URL for extracting data and supply a query string

    http://127.0.0.1/?t0=20090420&t1=20090422&unit=pageviews&d0=user&d0v=goldman,kropotkin

and the result returned is JSON.
