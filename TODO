docs:
+ setup github pages.
+ write FAQs on heap size and other tweaks.
+ write a decent running example to build docs and example confs around.
+ examples examples examples!

priority uno:
+ TODO => tickets
+ schema that supports >500k attribute values.
+ support mapper class (with counters and other goodness).
+ add support for multiple data sets.
+ zohmg/create.py: make default dataset.yaml follow the running example.
+ zohmg/create.py: make default mapper follow running example.
+ run zohmg jobs locally (dev-mode).
+ generally do less work in __init__

gui:
+ connect metadata to select-dropdowns.
+ add progress spinner.
+ report size of data set.
+ report errors.

performance:
+ how many column families can we use? (less than 500k for sure)

potential problems:
+ wsurl is hardcoded to localhost in zohmg.js

priority due:
+ (some day/maybe) in usermapper, add timestamp to map of dimensions.
+ (some day/maybe) source dist, would distribute source and depend on thrift etc to build.
+ (some day/maybe) binary dist, ready to use eggs.
+ (some day/maybe) some update step for post-setup alterations to dataset.yaml
+ (some day/maybe) put address and ports for servers and software in config (hbase REST et al)
+ (some day/maybe) build HBase thrift interface
+ (some day/maybe) ask user for path to Hbase.thrift and build hbase-*.egg
+ (some day/maybe) warn user when config is missing (what does this mean?)
+ (some day/maybe) can't use dash-values, can we? what to do; escape, or let
+ (some day/maybe) verify dimensions and units outputted by mapper.
+ (maybe never) support auto-installation on non-debian system.
+ (maybe never) support for installing in user-home
