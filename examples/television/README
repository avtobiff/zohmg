This is your zohmg application!

In a nutshell:
Configure config/dataset.yaml to match your data,
set the variables in config/environment.py,
run 'zohmg setup' to create an hbase table,
write a mapper and run it with 'zohmg import'.

See /usr/local/share/zohmg/doc/README for further documentation
and /usr/local/share/zohmg/examples for, yes, examples.
