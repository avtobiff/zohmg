+ Are you getting ImportError in your mapper?
Make sure you put the eggs for all non-standard python modules
that your mapper use in the lib directory of your application.

+ Are you getting this error: 'TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found'?
Make sure your mapper sets the value of all dimensions to strings, not integers.
