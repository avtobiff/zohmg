  - graphical element in 2.2.2 to describe mapreduces
+ abstract: non-buzzword; focus on problem
+ introduction: introduce time-series, data warehousing, mapreduce, bigtable
+ introduction: why is time important? we query for time, etc.
+ method:
+ implementation:
+ discussion:
+ write about related work.

* MapReduce framework description is too brief. Expand!


* 2.2 is a bit off.
* Why starsql scales worse -> [[citation needed], pretty typing]
* ch4,software,benchmarks -> add benchmarks and text
* 5.3 and 5.4 seem like unfinished notes.
* Chapter 6 needs to be finished.
* I noticed that the repository contains some other material (documentation,
 FAQ's). I think it might make sense to include these as an appendix too. The
 README is a rather useful complement to the thesis. Perhaps you can reference
 that from the main document, or perhaps include some of this info in the main
 document.
* Limits on cardinality
 + ch3, System Components -> TODO: Limits on cardinality
 + 4.3 Scope -> TODO: add summary on limits on cardinality
* p9
  + Your review suggests that there was nothing before MapReduce. But there seems to have been a lot of other work on datawarehousing before mapreduce appeared on the scene.
* Existing Software
* p20
  In this section I'd like to see a big graphic of the overall architecture
  and workflow.
