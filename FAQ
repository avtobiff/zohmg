+ Are you getting ImportError in your mapper?
Make sure you put the eggs for all non-standard python modules
that your mapper use in the lib directory of your application.


+ Are you getting this error: 'TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found'?
Make sure your mapper sets the value of all dimensions to strings, not integers.


+ What does this exception mean and how do I fix it?
java.lang.NullPointerException

<snip>

Check the stdout and stderr in the Hadoop webui for more information. It could be:
* That your mapper outputs all the dimensions you have specified in your dataset.yaml file.
* That there's a python library missing, check the DEPENDENCIES file for more information.


+ What does this error mean?
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

The units you output have to be of type int. In this case it's a string instead,
you can typecast it like so: int(variable)
