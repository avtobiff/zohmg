+ My mapper raises an ImportError. What's wrong?

The mapper fails to import a module. Make sure you put the eggs for
all non-standard python modules that your mapper use in the lib
directory of your application.


+ What does this exception mean and how do I fix it?

java.lang.NullPointerException
  at org.apache.hadoop.io.BytesWritable.(BytesWritable.java:50)
  at org.apache.hadoop.typedbytes.TypedBytesWritable.(TypedBytesWritable.java:41)
  at org.apache.hadoop.streaming.io.TypedBytesOutputReader.getLastOutput(TypedBytesOutputReader.java:73)
<snip>

Check the stdout and stderr in the Hadoop webui for more information. It could be:
* That your mapper outputs all the dimensions you have specified in your dataset.yaml file.
* That there's a python library missing, check the DEPENDENCIES file for more information.


+ What does this error mean?
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

The units you output have to be of type int. In this case it's a string instead,
you can typecast it like so: int(variable)


+ What does this error mean?
TypeError: sequence item 0: expected string, int found

The dimension attributes must be strings. In this case it's an int, so
you would have to typecast it like so: str(variable).


+ How can I speed up my mapper?

If you have the native libs built, enabling compression of map output may speed things up.
Set the flag like so: zohmg import <mapper> <input> -jobconf mapred.compress.map.output=true


+ How do I bundle python modules that my code needs?

Make an egg out of the module with easy_install and put that egg in the lib directory:

 $> easy_install -zmaxd . yrfavoritemodule
 $> cp yrfavoritemodule-0.1.egg lib


+ Why am I getting 'OSError: Permission denied' when running an import?

It could be that you do not have write permissions to
'lib/usermapper.py'. Make sure the user you're running the job as has
sufficient permissions.
